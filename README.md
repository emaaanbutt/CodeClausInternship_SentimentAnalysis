# 💬 Console-Based Sentiment Analyzer (Internship Project)

Hi there! 👋  
This is a *no-nonsense* console sentiment analysis tool I made for my internship. It's minimal, text-only, and runs in a loop until you tell it to stop (just like my brain during finals ✨).  

> 💡 Type anything. It'll tell you if it's Positive, Negative, or Neutral. Simple as that.

---

## 🌟 Features
- Analyze any sentence's sentiment (English only for now)
- Instant feedback: Positive 😊 | Negative 😞 | Neutral 😐
- Runs in a loop so you can vibe-test your entire chat history if you want
- Type `exit` to, well, exit 🚪

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **TextBlob** (because training a model from scratch for this was *not the vibe*)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**  
   If you haven’t already:
   ```bash
   pip install textblob
   python -m textblob.download_corpora

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to work with TextBlob for sentiment analysis
- The importance of keeping things simple (especially when sleep-deprived)
- CLI apps can be surprisingly fun to build
- You don’t always need fancy UIs to make a point

---

## ✨ Extra Notes
- This project is tiny but mighty — built with Python, good vibes, and 0 stress
- If I had more time:
    → Would’ve added sarcasm detection (dangerous territory lol)
    → Maybe logged all inputs to see how dramatic people are
    → Could’ve even made a mood calendar 🌧️☀️
- But hey, it works — and that's the goal!
